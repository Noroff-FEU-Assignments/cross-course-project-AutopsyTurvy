    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">  
      It should first be acknowledged that web attacks come in many different forms, so partaking in web security testing at every stage of the web design process is wise- 
      It is particularly important if your website deals with the personal information of their clients. 
      As well as understanding where the most common threats come from, it is imperative to have code written in a way that will prevent it being compromised through cross-site-scripting or SQL injection. 
      <br /> 
      Your server should also be configured to an HTTPS server that will ensure any information passed between your client and your server is encrypted. A small addition to this tactic would be to ensure that if sensitive information is taken,
       that only part of the information is kept- only enough of a card number to identify said client, but not enough for a criminal to use. 
      <br /> 
      You can utilize vulnerability scanning to discover areas that might need some work, 
      though should ensure that this is done throughout the development process to be certain that security is upheld as the site progresses.
       Vulnerability scanning will not catch every “hole” so a company may also hire trusted “hackers” to perform penetration testing to probe the limits of your security.  Larger companies usually extend this to adopting a vulnerability disclosure policy and invest in ongoing professional relationships with “Hackers” to test web security and report their findings.  </p>
